# ICS4U-2-Database-2020
In my second project, I used object-oriented programming to develop an interactive Contact Tracing Database saved in the browser. This database allows users to easily access a web app to enter their meeting details and suggests the next steps if confirmed positive cases are identified from contact history.

# User interface:

1. Input the information of the person you have met in the form. This includes their name, the date of your meeting, whether it is indoors or outdoors, the distance between the two of you, the length of your meeting and whether you both wore masks
2. Press Submit. The information should appear in the table above
3. It is recommended that you add a contact if your meeting fulfills one of these requirements: it lasted for more than 5 minutes, one or both of you did not wear masks or the distance between you was less than 2 meters.
4. If for some reason you want to delete an entry, press the delete button (this action cannot be undone)
5. If you learned that one of your contacts are confirmed with COVID 19, press the Confirm button on their row
6. Answer the window prompt by entering the date when they were confirmed (please use the format YYYY-MM-DD)
7. Read the suggestions on the window prompt and decide what you should do next

Note: The suggestions provided is just a recommendation, please decided your next steps according to your situation
